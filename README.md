# My Current NixOS Setup

This is a work in progress. I'm still learning how to use NixOS. Please please PLEASE don't judge me on how ugly, disorganized, and wrong all these files are. I'm dumb as a rock and I really know it's all kinda wrong and misconfigured. Any suggestions and corrections to my setup are welcome btw c:
